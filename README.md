## üí° Tips & Best Practices

### Model Selection Guide

**When to use each Denoise model**:
- **Normal**: Digital camera noise, mild ISO noise
- **Strong**: Scan artifacts, moderate noise from older cameras
- **Extreme**: Heavy film grain, severe digital noise, very old photos

**When to use each Enhance model**:
- **Standard V2**: Most photographs, general enhancement
- **Low Resolution V2**: Social media images, web graphics, thumbnails
- **CGI**: Digital art, 3D renders, illustrations
- **High Fidelity V2**: Professional photography, detailed texture preservation
- **Text Refine**: Screenshots, documents, images with text

**When to use each Creative Enhance model** ‚ú®:
- **Redefine**: Artistic enhancement, creative interpretation, modern photos
- **Recovery**: Damaged photo restoration with creative elements
- **Recovery V2**: Advanced restoration with maximum quality and creative enhancement

### Parameter Tuning Tips

1. **Start Conservative**: Begin with lower values and increase gradually
2. **Preview Effects**: Use the status messages to track processing parameters
3. **Chain Thoughtfully**: Denoise first, then enhance for best results
4. **Face Priority**: Enable face enhancement for portraits and group photos
5. **Format Choice**: Use PNG for archival quality, JPEG for smaller files
6. **Creative Balance**: Higher creativity = more dramatic changes, use sparingly
7. **Prompt Crafting**: Be specific but concise in creative prompts
8. **Seed Consistency**: Use seeds for reproducible creative results

### Workflow Optimization

- **Single Pass**: For light enhancement, use Enhance alone
- **Two Pass**: For heavily degraded images, use Denoise ‚Üí Enhance
- **Creative Pass**: For artistic effects, use Creative Enhance alone or after cleanup
- **Three Pass Ultimate**: Denoise ‚Üí Enhance ‚Üí Creative Enhance for maximum quality
- **Batch Processing**: Connect multiple images to process sets efficiently
- **Quality Check**: Monitor the hash values in status to ensure different images are processed

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No input image provided"**
- Ensure an image is connected to the input
- Check that the image artifact is valid
- Verify the connection is properly established

**"API key not found"**
- Set the `TOPAZ_LABS_API_KEY` environment variable
- Restart Griptape Nodes after setting the environment variable
- Verify the API key is valid and active

**"Request timed out"**
- Large images may take longer to process
- Creative models take longer than standard models
- Check your internet connection
- Verify Topaz Labs API service status

**"Authentication failed"**
- Check your API key is correct
- Verify your Topaz Labs account is active
- Ensure you have sufficient API credits

**Creative Enhancement Issues**:
- Empty prompts with autoprompt disabled may cause errors
- Very high creativity settings may produce unexpected results
- Generative models consume more API credits

### Debug Information

All nodes provide detailed status information:
- Image type and identifier
- Image size in bytes
- Processing hash (to verify different images)
- Current processing stage
- Success/error messages

Use this information to track processing and identify issues.

## üìã API Limits & Considerations

- **File Size**: Images are processed as uploaded, larger files take longer
- **Rate Limits**: Respect Topaz Labs API rate limiting
- **Credits**: Processing consumes API credits based on image size and complexity
- **Timeout**: Large images may timeout after 5 minutes
- **Formats**: Supports common formats (JPEG, PNG, WebP)
- **Generative Models**: Creative enhance models consume more credits and processing time
